## Build Docker image and publish to Docker Hub

search for `Docker Hub` in [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/).

- "Docker" is most popular plugin but has lots of dependencies and features which we don't need so will got with a simple 'CloudBees Docker Build & Publish' plugin

In Jenkins - _Manage Jenkins_ ... _Manage Plugins_

- from `Available` tab install CloudBees Docker Build & Publish

In job, add _build and publish_ step

- repo: `your docker hub repo`
- registry credentials - add new username/password
- use Docker Hub username and [authentication token](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)
- advanced - Dockerfile path 

-- Build now

- add build environment, hub credentials:
  - `DOCKER_HUB_USER`
  - `DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD`
- add build step, before build & push

```
docker login -u $DOCKER_HUB_USER -p $DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD
```
